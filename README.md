# Risk-and-Returns-The-Sharpe-Ratio
DataCamp Project: Risk and Return - The Sharpe Ratio

This is a DataCamp Project on calculating the Sharpe Ratio (Information Ratio) to evaluatie the two tech giants Facebook and Amazon. As benchmark, we used the S&P 500 that measures the performance of the 500 largest stocks in the US. When we use a stock index instead of the risk-free rate, the result is called the Information Ratio and is used to benchmark the return on active portfolio management because it tells you how much more return for a given unit of risk your portfolio manager earned relative to just putting your money into a low-cost index fund.
